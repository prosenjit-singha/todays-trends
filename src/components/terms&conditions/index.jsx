              <SpanText>
                In case of a dispute between the Parties relating to or arising
                out of this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt to
                resolve the dispute personally and in good faith. If these
                personal resolution attempts fail, the Parties shall then submit
                the dispute to binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be
                conducted in Cobb County, Georgia. The arbitration shall be
                conducted by a single arbitrator, and such arbitrator shall have
                no authority to add Parties, vary the provisions of this
                Agreement, award punitive damages, or certify a class. The
                arbitrator shall be bound by applicable and governing Federal
                law as well as the law of the following state: Georgia. Each
                Party shall pay their own costs and fees. Claims necessitating
                arbitration under this section include, but are not limited to:
                contract claims, tort claims, claims based on Federal and state
                law, and claims based on local laws, ordinances, statutes or
                regulations. Intellectual property claims by the Company will
                not be subject to arbitration and may, as an exception to this
                sub-part, be litigated. The Parties, in agreement with this
                sub-part of this Agreement, waive any rights they may have to a
                jury trial in regard to arbitral claims.
